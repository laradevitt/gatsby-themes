# gatsby-starter-just-basics

Bare bones starter site for use with @laradevitt/gatsby-theme-just-basics.

### If you just want the starter:

Clone the whole parent repo into `gatsby-starter-just-basics`:

```cli
git clone https://github.com/laradevitt/gatsby-themes.git gatsby-starter-just-basics
```

Then, filter the cloned repo by subdirectory:

```cli
cd gatsby-starter-just-basics
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter sites/gatsby-starter-just-basics
```

**Important!** Delete the *.git* directory and re-initialize as a new repo.
